    "In section 3.4 we are told that \"the information index $I_{11}$ is the curvature of the log-likelihood of $\\theta_1$ , where $\\theta_2$ is assumed known at the observed MLE $\\hat{\\theta}_2$, while $(I^{11})^{-1}$ is the information on $\\theta_1$ that takes into account that $\\theta_2$ is unknown. Hence, it is sensible $I_{11}$ is greater than $(I^{11})^{-1}$.\"\n",

    "Clearly, if $I_{11} = (I^{11})^{-1}$, we have no uncertainty about $\\theta_2$. It must be known at the observed MLE $\\hat{\\theta}_2$. Statistically, there is no inference to be performed on $\\theta_2$ and we have a stastical model that is truly only a one parameter model dependent on $\\theta_1$. Essentially, with regards to the parameter $\\theta_2$, the sample we have is a perfect representation of the population about which we are trying to make inferences."
